## üç∫ Featured Beer: Armand Ter Dolen

This episode features Armand Ter Dolen, a Belgian Blonde by Ter Dolen. It's a fruity blond beer with an explosion of citrus, thanks to dry-hopping with Cascade hops. Slightly cloudy with a snow white head, it's a gold medal winner at the Brussels Beer Challenge and a perfect match for our tech discussions.
