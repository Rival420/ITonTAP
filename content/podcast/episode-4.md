## Episode Summary

Last episode of the year so time to make our new years resolutions!

What starts out as a podcast about continuous improvement, goes towards talking current projects, announcements from Microsoft Ignite, basic user training and chaos.

With all that clowning around luckily they still end up with a beer, The Circus Saison.
