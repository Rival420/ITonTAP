## Episode Summary

In this 10th episode of IT on TAP, Nick and Pieter dive into the essential (and often overlooked) world of software security. Starting with the basics, we break down what software really is and how it's built‚Äîbefore peeling back the layers to uncover how vulnerabilities creep in.

We discuss:
- üîê How attackers exploit insecure code
- üî® The difference between static and dynamic code analysis
- üì¶ Why a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is more than just a buzzword

And of course, no episode is complete without a great beer in hand. This round, we're sipping on the [Duvel Imperial Blond](https://untappd.com/b/duvel-moortgat-duvel-imperial-blond/6203637)‚Äîa strong golden ale with a bold character, subtle hop bitterness, and a dry finish that pairs surprisingly well with discussions about secure code and digital threats.

Whether you're a developer, security pro, or just curious how the tech you use every day stays (or doesn't stay) secure‚Äîthis episode has something for you.

Grab your drink of choice and join us for another round of insight on IT on TAP!
