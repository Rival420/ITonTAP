## Episode Summary

In this episode of IT on TAP, Pieter and Nick crack open a bottle of The Circus IPA (courtesy of the clown himself) and dive into the world of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). We break down what the CVE program is, why it matters, and how it shapes the constantly evolving battlefield of cybersecurity. Along the way, we share real stories‚Äîfrom our own experiences and beyond‚Äîthat highlight just how impactful (and sometimes bizarre) vulnerabilities can be.

And of course, no circus is complete without a foreign surprise act‚Ä¶ Tune in to find out what that means.
